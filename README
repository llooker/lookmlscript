Dependencies:

	All Envirs:
		python 3.6+ (plan to eventually make it compatiable with 2.x)
		pip install jinja2
		pip install pyodbc
		
	Windows:
		windows will use the native {SQL Server} driver 
	
	Unix-Like:
		need to install odbc drivers for sql server using the instructions here: 
			
	Database:
		I haven't tested it with 'Windows Authentication mode', so I would work under the assumption you need a sql server auth enabled login
		This has been tested on MSSQL 2016 Express edition, the sql server odbc driver should have broad compatibility

		Installing the drivers: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server

		Postgres:
